      'I’d love to start exploring more onboarding experiences for different apps. Onboarding and user activation is an incredibly nuanced and challenging problem for designers, and it’s an ever-evolving process to understand and improve the experience for people new to a product. I really appreciate what Pinterest does – both on their app and website – with their new user experience.\r\n\r\nThe focus here is entirely on benefits, not features. They don’t talk about pins, sharing, social media, et cetera. No – they talk about how people are using the app to solve real challenges or problems in their lives. The panning images here, accompanied by the simple value statements, make for a compelling (and intriguing) experience.',
