    '[Pinterest](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pinterest/id429047995?mt=8\u0026utm_medium=login_desktop\u0026install_id=3bde228666804501b0b3b81bc79aa148) is an app I wish I could use more. I’ve never quite found my stride on the platform despite following several boards dedicated to design, UI and UX. Regardless of my own lack of engagement, there are millions of folks out there that use Pinterest every day to organize, plan, inspire, design, build and dream. There aren’t too many products out there that offer such a wide variety of benefits, despite offering the same feature set across the board. I love that.\r\n\r\nPinterest, in addition to being a wonderful utility for so many people, is shipping some of the best design in the world. They have a quiet, soft and unassuming interface across web and iOS that remains out of the way and lets people focus on their own individual needs. In this Design Details post I’ll explore a few of the wonderful interactions in Pinterest for iOS – enjoy!',
