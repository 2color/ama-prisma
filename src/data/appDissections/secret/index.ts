    '[Secret](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/secret-speak-freely/id775307543?mt=8) is the latest app making waves on the web, already being coined as Silicon Valley’s [latest obsession](http://techland.time.com/2014/02/08/secret-app/).\r\n\r\nWhile I don’t see myself as a user for this type of app, I thought that this would make for another excellent Design Details post. Secret does several things quite well, making sure to keep the interface and interactions super lightweight and wonderfully minimal.',
