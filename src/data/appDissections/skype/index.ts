    '[Skype for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skype-for-iphone/id304878510?mt=8) released their 5.0 update for iOS last week. As a heavy Google+ Hangouts/Facetime user, Skype has been outside of my product radar for quite some time. Despite my lack of familiarity, Skypeâ€™s update shows an incredible amount of polish and attention to detail that designers out there will enjoy!',
