      'Okay so this interaction is a bit jerky, with a strange black flash. I believe that’s being caused my recording software, so I won’t hold it against SoundCloud. If there’s anything I think we can take away from SoundCloud’s redesigned iOS app is the total, focused and uninterrupted prominence of listening to music.\r\n\r\nNotice that when I start playing a song, the album art fills my screen and SoundCloud’s signature waveform bubbles into view. It’s insanely minimalistic and clean, which, depending on how you use SoundCloud, is either a major win or an abysmal let-down (i.e. no more commenting). The last I heard, the SoundCloud team has intentionally stripped away features from the app and will revisit them in time.\r\n\r\nFor now, this feels like a listener’s heaven.',

No more tapping aimlessly on the bottom of your phone to try and navigate through your music.\r\n\r\nI like this.\r\n\r\nTap anywhere on your screen to play or pause the song.

      'Switching between music apps on an iPhone is one big guessing game. Spotify, Hypem, the native music app – all different styles, different controls and different layouts. When I’m driving down the road at 75mph, the last thing I need is to be looking at my phone to change songs.\r\n\r\nSoundCloud is on to something with this new interface – just swipe left or right (outside of the waveform) to change songs. It’s so simple, it makes you wonder why this hasn’t been done before.\r\n\r\nPS – if this has been done before, I’d love to take a look!',

      'I feel like a broken record now, but wow – I’m totally loving this quick scrubbing of the track waveform. No more itsy-bitsy slider nestled in between buttons and song controls – nope, just slide your finger along the massive touch area to scrub your song.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve been paying close attention throughout these past few videos, I’m sure you’ve noticed one slick design detail here: the very subtle parallax effect on the music controls and album artwork as the song progresses. The cover art slides slowly to the left, creeping along, as the seconds tick by on the track.',

      'To get back to the main song stream, just swipe down. No back button, no ‘close’ text. Just a simple gesture to get you back to the start. This feels really nice to use, I can’t lie.\r\n\r\nOne other detail to notice here is the animated toolbar icon, subtly reminding you how to get back to the song in progress. This is definitely an element of design that I haven’t seen in any other iOS app up until now, and I must admit it feels quite nice. I think that, if used in moderation, other app designers could take a cue here to add some motion and life to the core UI of their apps.\r\n\r\nI actually chose the wrong track here to demonstrate another detail, but the bottom toolbar is actually semi-transparent. A subtle gesture to hint at the song playing underneath. I love it!',
