      'If you don’t use multiple Twitter accounts, it’s likely that you’ve never seen this interaction before. Pulling down on your profile pulls in the account switcher. I love the way the cover photo expands and blurs (a detail many other apps have begun to adopt).\r\n\r\nI’ve had to watch this detail several times to really catch everything going on. The playful bounces and the way the profiles ease into view makes using the app and switching profiles too much fun.',
