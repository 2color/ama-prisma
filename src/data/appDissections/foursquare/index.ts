    '[Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/download) is entering a new era. The long-time check-in service has undergone a radical redesign and reposition with its 8.0 release for iOS. No longer is Foursquare an app to check in at your favorite places and keep tabs on your friends – no, it’s now attempting to become the de facto recommendation engine for food and entertainment. The Verge has [explained this repositioning](http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/6/5973627/foursquare-8-review-the-ultimate-food-finder) quite clearly: The new app cuts through Foursquare’s massive corpus of data to answer one question: what if your food-finding app knew your favorite restaurants, but also your favorite foods?\r\n\r\nRegardless of where you turn to find the best restaurants in your area, it’s no question that Foursquare is making a bold move into the arena dominated by the massively-popular Yelp. The 8.0 version of their iOS app takes this bold move quite seriously, bringing in a wonderfully simple and clear redesign.',
