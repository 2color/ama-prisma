      'The pull-to-refresh interaction has become a universally-known gesture for smartphone users. Being so universal provides a hidden challenge for app designers: how do we stand out? Foursquare has embodied a clear simplicity in this detail – a pulsating ring, honing in on your location.\r\n\r\nI love how smooth this detail is – the way the ring fills and expands as you pull down, springing to life once released.',

      'In previous versions of Foursquare, users needed to request permission to follow someone else. The nature of checking in and broadcasting your location necessitated a higher level of privacy for its users. With Foursquare’s latest shift, the emphasis is no longer on check-ins, but on recommendations. For this reason, following someone else no longer requires permission and is a low-barrier action that Foursquare hopes people will find useful.\r\n\r\nThis detail is small, but worth noting: when following someone (or…something perhaps), the transition of the checkmark element is quite slick. It’s certainly not a deal breaker, but I wish that there was an equal level of polish whenever I stopped following someone, rather than having such an instant, static state change.',
