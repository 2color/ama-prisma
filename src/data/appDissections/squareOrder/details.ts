      'While this walkthrough design pattern is used by just about every app coming out these days, I’m struck by how Square moved beyond static imagery to incorporate gestures, movement and light animations to draw users in and help them to focus on each step’s instructions. Even the little things – like the way the birds bounce up and down on the roof in the third slide – add a significant amount of emotional connection for first-time users.',

      'Square Order starts to set user expectations about navigation and design from the very first interaction. Here, I’m entering my email address. Since I already have an account, the screen immediately transitions to prompt for my password. The whole view doesn’t change, but rather the information I need slides gently into view.\r\n\r\nFrom a UX point of view, I could see this being a potential point of confusion for some people. When I enter my email, it’s actually not super clear that the text input has changed and that I’m being prompted for a password. I’m of two minds about whether this was the right decision:\r\n\r\nOn one hand, I think that Square’s target market for this app is technologically-literate folks who are familiar with applications and will pay attention to what’s on the screen. That’s great for me, because it means Square can be a bit more daring with their usability patterns and step out of the typical login-flow comfort zone.\r\n\r\nOne the other hand, I can’t help but feel that Square Order was built only for a younger crowd with some degree of familiarity with technology. In this regard, I wonder if they might be limiting the accessibility of the application overall for people who might not be early adopter techies. What do you think?',

Creating visual separation and hierarchy among elements on a small screen requires skill and tact – I think Square Order has pulled these things off wonderfully.\r\n\r\nRather than constraining themselves to a tried-and-true design pattern in iOS apps to have the navbar separated by line or color, this app uses a light transition gradient to provide a sense of cohesion across the entire screen. It doesn’t feel like I’m looking at separate “chunks” of information displayed on a screen, but rather that I’m looking at one whole screen with a fluid stream of information.\r\n\r\nI fully expect a search option in the app soon, but for now you’ll need to scroll to find the right places for your order.',
