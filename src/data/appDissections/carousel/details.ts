This tells me that, for whatever reason, people weren’t interacting with the indicative scroll gesture on the splash screen, so Dropbox had to nudge people along.\r\n\r\nI’d love to know more behind that decision to auto-scroll users to the sign-in step, but for now it tells me that somewhere in the testing process the team found that people weren’t making it past the splash view.',

      'Carousel is a Dropbox product, so they already know I have an account and am logged in on the main application. So here I get a beautifully-simple sign-in flow that forgoes having to look up my password or go through a 2-step auth flow.\r\n\r\nThis view, I imagine, was a tough one to design. Here we have an app that, by its very nature, needs access to your photos. But they don’t just come right out and flag you with the iOS permissions notification. Instead, you have to opt-in with a clear text label and checkbox. If you try to sign-in without granting access to your photos, a subtle shake guides user’s eyes to the right place.\r\n\r\nTruthfully, I’m wondering how many people drop off from Carousel at this point. As an avid technology consumer and eager experimenter, of course I’m going to give Dropbox access to my photos. For someone that might not be as familiar with the product, parent company or even the concept of organizing your photos in the cloud, it might feel slightly more intrusive and daunting to grant this access.\r\n\r\nFor those brave enough to continue, there are wonderful things in store.',

It’s not just about creating a nice looking gallery of your photos and organizing them into albums. I can do that in Photos.app. I can do that on my Mac.

On one-hand, I can see it being helpful for someone less savvy on an iPhone. On the other hand, seeing that organization by date and location is just obvious – or, at least it’s obvious enough that I’m questioning such a prominent callout in the new-user experience.',

On a high level, I’m confused why I need a profile picture for Carousel – does this tie over to Dropbox? Does this show up anywhere? Can other people see it?\r\n\r\nI figure it’s basically just so that people you share photos with can see your photo. Maybe adding that explanation could make this process more inviting.

I’d say Dropbox is most famous for their web implementation of this flow, where they offer users extra storage for completing certain tasks or sharing Dropbox with friends. Here, they cleverly mix in two super-easy tasks (view a photo…right) with a viral component: share your photos with friends.\r\n\r\nThat’s how they getcha. That’s smart design.',

      'The time wheel is a really nice feature here. In most photo apps it can be a massive pain to scroll back through thousands of photos. I’ve been snapping smartphone pictures for 8 years now, so giving a quick way to access years and months makes so much sense.\r\n\r\nApple has done this by letting you zoom out in the “moments” view of the stock Photos app. Dropbox instead took a more linear, visually engaging way of helping users go back in time. Sometimes the timeline here is harder to pinpoint, but for the most part it’s fairly obvious and fits into my mental model of how my photos relate to each other chronologically.',
