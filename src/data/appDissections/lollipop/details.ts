      'I have to address up front how challenging it was to record the videos for this post. I scoured the Play store for good mirroring apps, I Googled my way down a dozen rabbit holes and eventually had to resort to Twitter to find the right answer – shoutout to [Jeremy Le Van](https://twitter.com/jeremylv) for the help! The solution: I had to download the Android SDK and platform tools in order to record the videos via command line prompts. I’m a bit shocked that we still haven’t seen a better solution here for screen recording on Android – devs, I would have paid $5-10 for an easy-to-use solution here. Wink wink.\r\n\r\nThese quirks aside, I’ve totally fallen for Lollipop’s aesthetic. Material Design has found its away across more apps and OS-level tools, making the entire experience consistent and comfortable. This lock screen (aside from the pesky debugging notification) is really slick – I love the slowly glowing ring around the lock icon.\r\n\r\nFrom a usability perspective, I still feel like Apple wins the first-user-experience battle. Slide to unlock is more clear, and iOS’s gesture hints (right-facing arrow + animation on the text) provides users with more context about what to do.',

      'Circles everywhere. If you’re not familiar with Material Design, or Android in general, this post will surprise you with how versatile the circle can be in a software world dominated by rounded rectangles. The shapes provide an interesting contrast and a breath of fresh air to software design.\r\n\r\nThe Material Design spec provides some more information about this design decision in [Responsive Interaction](http://www.google.com/design/spec/animation/responsive-interaction.html#):\r\n\r\n<blockquote>“Responsive interaction builds trust with the user and engages them. When a user interacts with an app and beautiful yet perfectly logical things happen, the user feels satisfied—even delighted. The interaction is thoughtful and purposeful, not random, and can be gently whimsical but never distracting. It encourages deeper exploration of an app.”</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIn this video, you can quickly access the camera or phone by swiping the bottom icons inwards (again, the usability here is questionable). I do, however, like the way the interface adjusts to your actions by fading out the other two calls-to-action along the bottom bar.',

      'The soft keys along the bottom of the screen – back, home and multi-tasking – are one of Androids biggest differentiators from iOS. Where iOS apps are adopting the swipe-to-go-back interaction, Android relies more heavily on the ‘back’ soft key that persists along the bottom of the screen. As a long-time iOS user, it’s hard for me to remember that this functionality even exists. But when I do remember, it’s a wonderful way to navigate through applications and it provides a beautifully-consistent navigation pattern across the entire system. This lack of consistency is a glaring usability issue on iOS.\r\n\r\nThis video just highlights some of the slick animations that accompany soft key taps. Pressing and holding the ‘home’ icon brings up the Google Now button – flicking your finger up will take you to Google Now.',

This isn’t really clear until you start tapping around.\r\n\r\nOne other cool thing that Dan pointed out to me was how different apps can secure a place in the settings pulldown. In this case, a screen capture app and a mobile hotspot automatically get added to this settings view.

That’s really important to casuals like myself.\r\n\r\nThe video above captures the camera app opening on Lollipop.
