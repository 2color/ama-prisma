No extra fuss or unneeded messaging – just a few simple steps to get started, the modal fades away, then users are greeted with this simple interface and tooltip on the main share button. You can tell how much time the designers put into the small details here – especially the language on the tooltip.\r\n\r\nCreate a moment – this introduces new users to this process of sharing moments, not fluff. This isn’t where you share your latest score on Candy Crush, no – it’s a place to share moments with your friends. I like that.',

Path’s most recent update brings some minor changes to this design detail, but the feel remains very much the same.\r\n\r\nTapping the ‘+’ button opens a flyout menu of all the various types of content you can share on Path. The icons playfully bounce outwards, spinning simultaneously. Sure, it might take a bit longer to cycle through the animations here, but the added delight it provides new users is invaluable.',

This is so cool to me – the most obvious answer here for any designer would be to include a simple ‘back’ or ‘close’ text line. But having the logo there (while maybe cognitively less obvious) adds some flavor and personality to the app.\r\n\r\n - Notice all the moving parts here as I spin the map around: The beautifully-designed compass twists so lightly as the text swirls in and out of view.

It’s a really slick transition effect that I see more and more apps using recently (looking at you, Twitter!).\r\n\r\nOnce I land in the composer view, I toggled the ‘close circle’ and ‘private’ options – the context indicators that slide into view are quite beautiful.

Continuing to scroll adjusts the date and time dynamically based on which post is underneath it on the view.
