    '[Path for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/path/id867760913) has long been associated with beautiful design and having an obsessive attention to detail. Despite slow adoption by the general public – which actually appears to have grown in recent months – I’ve found that Path has always been an under-appreciated and overlooked product. While I can’t call myself a heavy user, I’m a huge fan of any team that puts so much passion and love into their work.\r\n\r\nPath had a pretty big launch last week, unveiling a new standalone messaging app to accompany their flagship Path app. For me this was a clear reminder that Path deserved a spot here in the Design Details series. I hope you all enjoy these videos – give me a shout if I’ve overlooked anything!\r\n\r\nAnd of course, give the designers of this beautiful app a follow: [Dustin Mierau](https://twitter.com/dmierau) and [Ed Kim](https://twitter.com/edmuki).',
