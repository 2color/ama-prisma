      'What better way to onboard someone into a new app than to instantly share some of the beautiful creations they’ll be able to make? Hyperlapse nails this part, highlighting the function of the app in a concise and tasteful way.\r\n\r\nMy only negative note here is that the dots at the bottom of the screen (which indicate your current page) are really hard to see. I can imagine some folks getting stuck here waiting for something to happen without realizing they need to swipe left.\r\n\r\nAlso of note: pay attention to the rounded corners of the app, throughout. A very small and subtle touch (that admittedly looks much sharper against the bezel of the iPhone) which adds a tasteful splash of character.',

Here, we initiate the app by giving permission to access the camera (which I’ve done prior to this recording).\r\n\r\nNote the responsiveness of the button to my touch, the way the video pauses and blurs, and of course, the way the tutorial tooltip springs into action.',
