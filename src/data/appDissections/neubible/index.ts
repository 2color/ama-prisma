    "[NeuBible](http://www.neubible.co/) is, well, a Bible-reading app. Built by [Kory Westerhold](https://twitter.com/iamkory), [Aaron Martin](https://twitter.com/iamaaronmartin), and [Zach Whelchel](https://twitter.com/zachwhelchel), NeuBible is a masterfully-executed product overflowing with fun details.\r\n\r\nVisually, the app is one of the cleanest, most well-composed apps I've downloaded. In terms of navigation, usability, and readability, the app invites an emotional attachment that many other products could only dream of (more on this later). By tastefully combining stock and non-stock UI elements, NeuBible has created something entirely new and interesting.\r\n\r\nBelow are some of my favorite design details in NeuBible for iOS.",
