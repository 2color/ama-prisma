This happens in about 0.1% of all apps; social sign-ins, tedious walkthroughs, or long-winded intro videos have become the norm. It's a shame because it seems that *most* apps could very realistically offer a very complete and valuable signed-out experience for people who are curious and need more signal.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to see NeuBible *just work*. No fuss, no signup, no over-the-top splash view. Nope, just the content you downloaded the app for in the first place.",

In that way you can see, live, how your reading experience will be changed with each tweak of the settings.\r\n\r\nThis is smart product thinking and a delightful experience; I appreciate how simple the customizations are and how opinionated the creators are about what makes for a good reading experience. There aren't dozens of typeface options. No, just four that the creators think are *good*. Opinionated design like this is great because it gives us a glimpse into the mind of the designer in a way that generalized systems never will. ",

      "Jumping straight to chapters in a book is one of the less-discoverable bits of UI in NeuBible. I don't fully understand the use case here, so it might very well be a subdued interaction for a reason. My initial reaction was that being able to jump to a specific chapter might be a higher intent user goal, and having to swipe to filter by chapter wasn't immediately obvious.\r\n\r\nRegardless, this is probably the first time I've ever seen a table cell swipe interaction be used as a navigation element rather than an action trigger (think: swipe to delete in Mail.app).

      'I love the timeline structure of the highlights view. It builds a reverse-chronological history of your favorite verses and passages. Ordering highlights by the date of creation, rather than by location in the overall text, is an interesting decision. I agree with it, however, because it gives the feeling of curating ideas and discovery over time, rather than a feeling of finding needles in a haystack of text.\r\n\r\nI would also suppose that the highlights ordering lends to this subtle, emotional feeling of *this app is my own*. The small customizations and tweaks that happen in the system all add up to an app that will never feel the same between any two people, even if the underlying content remains untouched.',

Watching it happen live is fun and makes you feel like the app is your own – it's no longer a stock Bible that millions of other people see. No, this is *your* space finely tuned to your own aesthetic and reading style.\r\n\r\nBuilding this emotional connection to an app or service isn't easy or straightforward.
