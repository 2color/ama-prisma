    '[Flickr for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flickr/id328407587?ls=1\u0026mt=8) dropped a major update late last week. It’s an impressive redesign worthy of attention from photographers and designers alike. I’m excited about Yahoo’s renewed energy in the mobile space, and judging by the work that went into this update, it’s clear that their designers aren’t cutting any corners.',
