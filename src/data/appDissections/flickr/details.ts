It took me a while to explore this view and get comfortable knowing what options were at my disposal. In this case it seems like Flickr has buried some functionality that is quite fun to use – I’m not sure if the tradeoff makes much sense for an app of this nature.\r\n\r\nIn cases like these, however, I trust that the designers/engineers made the best decision possible with all available information.
